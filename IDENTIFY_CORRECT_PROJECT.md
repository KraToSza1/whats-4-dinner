# 🔍 Identify the CORRECT Project

## Quick Check:

**In Vercel Dashboard:**

1. **Look at your projects list** - you should see:
   - Project 1: `whats-4-dinner` (old/outdated?)
   - Project 2: `whats-4-dinner` (new/correct?)

2. **Check the GitHub connection:**
   - Click on EACH project
   - Go to **Settings** → **Git**
   - Which one is connected to: `KraToSza1/whats-4-dinner`?
   - **That's the CORRECT one!**

3. **Check the deployment URL:**
   - The CORRECT project should have recent deployments
   - Look at the deployment that says "Initial commit - What's 4 Dinner project"
   - That's the NEW one!

## Tell Me:

1. **How many "whats-4-dinner" projects do you see in Vercel?**
2. **What are their URLs?** (e.g., `whats-4-dinner-xyz.vercel.app`)
3. **Which one has the latest code?** (the one showing your current app)

Once we identify the CORRECT project, we'll add Paddle variables to THAT one only!

**Quick way to check:**
- The CORRECT project should have deployments from TODAY (Nov 25, 2025)
- The OLD project will have older deployments
