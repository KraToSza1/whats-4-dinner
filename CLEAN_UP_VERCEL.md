# 🧹 Clean Up Vercel Projects - Step by Step

## ✅ Step 1: Identify the CORRECT Project

From your screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ Connected to: `KraToSza1/whats-4-dinner` (CORRECT!)
- ✅ Connected: Oct 30 (this is the one we want)

**This is the CORRECT project!** Keep this one.

## ✅ Step 2: Delete OLD Projects

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Find ALL "whats-4-dinner" projects:**
   - Look at your projects list
   - Find any project named "whats-4-dinner" or similar

3. **For EACH project (except the CORRECT one):**
   - Click on the project
   - Go to **Settings** → Scroll to bottom
   - Click **"Delete Project"**
   - Type the project name to confirm
   - Click **"Delete"**

4. **Keep ONLY the one that:**
   - Is connected to `KraToSza1/whats-4-dinner`
   - Was connected on Oct 30
   - Has recent deployments

## ✅ Step 3: Verify the CORRECT Project

1. **Go to the CORRECT project** (the one connected Oct 30)
2. **Check Deployments:**
   - Should have deployment from today/26 minutes ago
   - Should say "Initial commit - What's 4 Dinner project"

3. **Check Settings → Git:**
   - Should show: `KraToSza1/whats-4-dinner`
   - Connected: Oct 30

## ✅ Step 4: Add Paddle Variables (After Cleanup)

Once you've deleted the old ones, we'll add Paddle variables to the CORRECT project.
