## What Cook Mode Does

Cook Mode is a **step-by-step cooking assistant** that helps you follow recipes one step at a time. Here's what happens when you're on Step 5 of 13:

### Current Features:

1. **View Current Step** - Shows you the instruction for Step 5
2. **Check Off Steps** - Click the checkbox to mark Step 5 as complete
3. **Auto-Advance** - When you check off Step 5, it automatically moves to Step 6
4. **Timer Buttons** - Use quick timers (30s, 1m, 2m, 5m) if the step needs timing
5. **Navigate** - Use Previous/Next buttons or click any step in the list to jump to it
6. **Progress Tracking** - See how many steps you've completed (progress bar at top)

### How to Use:

1. **Read the step** - Look at the instruction for Step 5
2. **Do the action** - Follow the instruction (e.g., "Cinnamon and salt")
3. **Check it off** - Click the checkbox when done
4. **Auto-advance** - It moves to Step 6 automatically
5. **Use timer** - If needed, click a timer button (e.g., "2m" for 2 minutes)

### Visual Indicators:

- **Green dot (wider)** = Current step you're on
- **Green dots (smaller)** = Completed steps
- **Gray dots** = Steps not yet done
- **Green background** = Current step card
- **Checkmark** = Step is completed

This is working as designed! You're viewing Step 5, and you can interact with it by checking it off, using timers, or navigating to other steps.
