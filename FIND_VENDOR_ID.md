# 🔍 How to Find Your Paddle Vendor ID

The Vendor ID is usually shown in one of these places:

## Option 1: Check the Top of Your Dashboard
1. Look at the **very top** of your Paddle dashboard
2. Sometimes it shows "Vendor ID: 123456" near your account name

## Option 2: Check Account Settings
1. Click on your **profile/account icon** (top right)
2. Go to **"Account Settings"** or **"Business Account"**
3. Look for **"Vendor ID"** or **"Account ID"**

## Option 3: Check the URL
1. Look at your browser's address bar
2. The URL might contain your vendor ID
3. Example: `sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/vendor/123456/...`

## Option 4: Check API Key Details
1. Click the **"..."** (three dots) next to your API key
2. Or click on the API key name "W4D"
3. Sometimes the Vendor ID is shown in the details

## Option 5: Create a Test API Call
If you can't find it, we can test without it first - the API key might work on its own for sandbox!

**Quick Check:**
