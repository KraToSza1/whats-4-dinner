# 🎯 Find the CORRECT Vercel Project

## What We Know:

**GitHub shows:**
- ✅ Repo: `KraToSza1/whats-4-dinner` (CORRECT)
- ✅ Preview deployment: 26 minutes ago (NEW/CORRECT)
- ⚠️ Production: 3 weeks ago (OLD)
- ⚠️ URL in About: `whats-4-dinner-mu.vercel.app` (might be OLD)

**Earlier we saw:**
- URL: `whats-4-dinner-git-master-raymonds-projects-17a8f0f7.vercel.app` (NEW?)

## Steps to Find CORRECT Project:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - https://vercel.com
   - Look at your projects

2. **Check EACH "whats-4-dinner" project:**

   **For EACH project, check:**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Look at the LATEST deployment
   - Does it say "Initial commit - What's 4 Dinner project"?
   - Does it say "26 minutes ago" or "today"?
   - **THAT'S THE CORRECT ONE!**

3. **Check the GitHub connection:**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Git**
   - Is it connected to `KraToSza1/whats-4-dinner`?
   - **THAT'S THE CORRECT ONE!**

## Tell Me:

1. **How many "whats-4-dinner" projects in Vercel?**
2. **What's the URL of the one with deployment from 26 minutes ago?**
3. **What's the URL of the old one (3 weeks ago)?**

Then we'll add Paddle variables to the CORRECT one only!
